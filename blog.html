			<h2>Open Letter</h2>
				<h3>November 5th, 2017</h3>
					<p>Hello Mr. Customer Service Guy,</p>
					<p>“This is Katie Xu, Emily’s daughter. No, her real name is Yun Zeng. That’s Y-U-N, space, Z-E-N-G. Yes, I will be the one talking to you from now on.” I often wonder how many times you’ve heard the switch in voices, the shuffling of clothes, and the snapping of mouths shut when you’re on the phone. I often wonder what it’s like to be on your end, to be listening in to the silent exchange of power between the “native” and the “naturalized” American. I often wonder what it’s like to sit there and just...talk.</p>
					<p>Talking. It seems like such a mundane thing. I mean, all you have to do is open your mouth and words come out. It must be nice, having a script in front of you so you know exactly what to say. Always the right words at the right time. The right sounding, too. A nice up and down rhythm that’s easy on the ears. No harsh, metallic clashes raising goosebumps on your skin. I mean, you’re not wrong, “chink” and “chunk” are common sounds of the kitchen, but is it really such a surprise to hear it in an outside context? Whenever I walk down the streets with my parents, I feel obliged to round out my words, make the “chink” sound more like a “chin” and the “chunk” sound more like a “chun.” My parents always gave me a weird look whenever I talked in that flat, dull tone, but hey, at least no more goosebumps for you, huh? </p>
					<p>Mr. Customer Service guy, I guess it’s really not your fault–you’re just trying to do your job and you need to be able to understand what your customer is saying. But where is my mother in this conversation? She’s sitting right next to me, gesturing and commenting frantically about her credit card bill, which, by the way, she said she paid on time. However, she’s taken a backseat in this conversation. Aren’t you supposed to converse directly with the customer? Put yourself in her shoes: you have a problem you need to solve but you can’t even solve it on your own because no one will listen to your “broken” English. As a result, you’re silenced on the other end, forced to rely on other people to relay your message for you. The meaning is misconstrued, the implication is made, the words are unsaid.</p>
					<p>Each time you hear this exchange happen is another time someone is silenced. Eventually, these silences speak up for itself: perhaps we are just not worthy to be heard. Society certainly has no demand for our voices, as proven by our underrepresentation in the media, or, in the times we are represented, at the butt of a joke. The only times we do speak is when we speak in accordance to your interpretation of our culture. Take Brenda Song on Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior. Or Jackie Chan in The Karate Kid. I mean, I get it, I really do. You think that devoting a whole movie to our culture will somehow make us feel honored by your thoughtfulness and consideration and–oh!–maybe we aren’t marginalized after all. I know this may come as a surprise to you, but our culture does not revolve around kung fu. We are so much more than that. We are firecrackers on Chinese New Year. We are qipaos at family functions. We are 4,000 years of history that have been reduced to nerds, geishas, and black belt ninja stars.</p>
					<p>Oh, I know. I know you’re trying to “fight the system.” I know you don’t want to be portrayed as the bad guy, and that’s why you invented London Tipton on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Hello, representation! For once, the Asian is not glasses-wearing, word-stammering, and socially-awkward looking: she is dumb, rich, and spoiled! Really, Hollywood? Is this how we combat racism nowadays? I think I should deserve a say in how I’m perceived and represented in society, especially since those chances don’t come to often. </p>
					<p>They really don’t. We get passed over even for our own culture’s roles. Karlie Kloss as a geisha on the cover of Vogue’s March 2017 issue. Did the population of Japanese models who could represent Japanese culture run out? Emma Stone as Allison Ng (who is a quarter Hawaiian and a quarter Chinese) in the movie Aloha. Was there no Chinese or Hawaiian actress who wanted to star in the movie? This whitewashing in mainstream media has a subliminal effect in teaching us that perhaps our culture is not something to be proud of, that perhaps these “white” versions of ourselves are our best selves. If at every opportunity an Asian magazine cover shot is given to the Caucasian counterpart and an Asian lead role is given to the Caucasian choice, how can we appreciate our own heritage if time and time again society teaches us not to? Despite actresses Constance Wu and Ming-Na Wen speaking up on behalf of the Asian community, the media continues their practice of whitewashing our culture while we begin accepting these westernized versions of ourselves as reality. Our true voice gets quieter and quieter…</p>
					<p>I’m sorry, Mr. Customer Service Guy, it’s not only your fault that I feel the need to lower my voice every time I speak my native tongue. It’s just that society sees us as this “model minority,” as if our quietness and submissiveness and subdued nature is something to be proud of. The truth is, I don’t understand who we’re supposed to be models for. It seems to me that we’re “models” because we are the only minorities willing to throw away our culture in order to fit into yours. When I was younger, I was ashamed at what made me Chinese. I eye-lined away my small monolids. I stopped bringing thermoses full of rice and “smelly” meat for lunch. I did everything I could to assimilate into American culture, yet still I was an outsider: good enough to be awarded this arbitrary “model minority” title, but not good enough to sit with you at the lunch table. </p>
					<p>By no means am I suggesting that not being able to sit with someone at the lunch table is a more serious issue than African Americans being shot or Native Americans being forced off their land. I’m not. But I am suggesting that not everything is as simple as it seems. The complexity of Asian discrimination is more nuanced than any of us can fathom. We have to recognize that our current discussion of racism is only in black and white terms. However, our struggle for equality is much more diverse than that. We exist in a world where society does not recognize the prejudices raised against my culture because our suffering is concealed by the label of “model minority.”</p>
					<p>You see, being the model minority is a scam. It’s a lie that keeps us placated because by being given this “honor,” it’s almost as if we aren’t suffering. It’s a lie overlooking the fact that, although Asians supposedly earn the highest salaries in America, we still “make $8,146 less than whites” in high skilled jobs (American Institute for Economic Research). This pay gap between Asian-Americans and whites can be seen through Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park’s experience in the entertainment industry. They decided to quit working for the network that was paying their white counterparts 15% more than what they were receiving, despite starring in the same number of episodes, “168 to be exact” (Chung). On a more representative scale, the National Women’s Law Center provides evidence that “for every dollar paid to a white, non-Hispanic man, an Asian woman who works full time only receives 85 cents, resulting in a loss of approximately $9000 every year.” It’s a lie overlooking the fact that, although we all supposedly have the “Asian Advantage” in education, there are racial disparities within the Asian conglomerate that reveal not all Asians are equal in educational success. According to Center for American Progress, “Southeast Asian groups such as Cambodian, Laotian, and Hmong students “have higher high school dropout rates than African Americans and Latinos.” Furthermore, Fuchs from NBC News cites a study that shows over 60% of Cambodian, Laotian, and Hmong people have not attended college, as opposed to 35% of Chinese-Americans. The tendency to generalize all of the different sub-groups within the Asian race is dangerous because it oversimplifies the complexity of the issue.</p> 
					<p>These lies have been perpetuated in this society for too long. I am tired of being labeled the model minority as if it was something to be proud of, as if it was even something true. The only reason it’s true is because you put value in it–not me. This social construct exists as a result of your need to justify the wrongs that have been done, and are still being done, to my culture. You gift us this trojan horse, thinking that we will accept it and its feeble attempt at peace, but we know better. We have to know better.</p> 
					<p>I remember in 2016, when an Asian police officer Peter Liang shot an unarmed African American man in Brooklyn. At first, initial speculations circled around the fact that Peter Liang would get sentenced to manslaughter despite it being claimed as an accidental firing. Following that was the first time I had ever seen the Asian community come together to protest–for anything, ever. According to Erika Lee, a University of Minnesota history professor, “Liang's case has mobilized a level of Asian-American activism not seen since the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1982 killing of Vincent Chin in a Detroit suburb.” You could not have imagined the atmosphere then; everyone was excited to finally have a taste of the American culture of free speech and protests and happily ever afters. But most of all, we were ecstatic to finally have a platform for which we could just...talk. </p>
					<p>Little did we know, it was all in vain. Our euphoric bubble burst the moment it was revealed that there was no way that a 11.5 pound trigger on a 9mm Glock could have been fired accidentally (Wang). The chanting, the protests–our moment of glory was over. We receded quietly into the background, once again assuming our positions as the “model minority.” But why? Why should we let one failure determine the fate of our voices? Thomas Edison “went on to hold more than 1,000 patents and invented some world-changing devices” despite his teachers telling him he was “too stupid to learn anything.” Dr. Seuss went on to become a “legendary children’s author” despite having “his first book rejected by 27 different publishers” (Sugar et al.). We should not let this one mistake set us back. We cannot become a self-fulfilling prophecy of silent suffering and turned heads. </p>
					<p>Can you put me on speaker? This is important. I am speaking to you, Chinese employee, who was the recipient of the harsh words “Go back to China” because you didn’t speak English in a Chinese specialty store (Herhalt). I am speaking to you, Korean immigrant students, who coped with racism by “silencing [your] racial experience and/or self-blaming for the incident or situation” (Choi and Lim). We cannot remain complacent in these injustices. I am sick of being used as a success story in order to propagate the existence of a meritocracy that, quite frankly, I have yet to see exists. I am tired of being seen as submissive and as quiet by my peers, as if I deal with no discrimination in my life. I’d rather be the story of rebellion, of chaos, of trouble, because then at least I’ll have known I did something, anything, to change the way we are living now.</p> 
					<p>I am speaking to you, but you must speak to me, too.</p>
					<p>Thank you for listening, Mr. Customer Service Guy, </p>

			<h2>Words from a Recovering Perfectionist</h2>
				<h3>April 12th, 2015</h3>
					<p>I worry about going to college. I worry about not being successful. I worry about waking up one morning and not remembering who I am. So yea, you get the point-I may have a bit of an anxious streak. When I was little, I used to psych myself out so much that I actually got sick before every major meet. Small meets were fine. Big meets where the pressure was astronomical? Not so fine. And it wasn’t so much as outside pressure that made my heart beat faster. No, it was something much closer to home-myself. I always gave myself so much stress that I had to be this embodiment of perfection, and anything less was unacceptable. However, it wasn’t until recently I realized that by trying to be perfect in itself is already setting yourself up for failure. There’s simply no such thing as being perfect. Sure, “perfect” gets thrown around at models, CEOs, and Nobel Peace Prize winners all the time. But if you ask the recipients of such high regards, they’ll tell you that there’s always something that they could have done better. Said better. Chosen better. Being perfect is like trying to count to infinity. Set goals that you can see yourself achieving. Don’t be that stubborn guy/ girl that wants to prove their math teacher wrong by trying to count to infinity. </p>
			<h2>The Light at the End of the Tunnel (no it's not about dying)</h2>
				<h3>April 11th, 2015</h3>
					<p>Today I’d like to share with you my thoughts on a happily ever after. Sure, as the years go by, there are missed opportunities, not (yet) reached goals, and failed relationships. But I’m here to tell you that you haven’t reached the end if you haven’t seen the light. For me, personally, I’d recently just achieved something after years and years of hard work-my junior national cut in the wonderful sport (yes, swimming IS a sport) of swimming. When you watch the Olympics and see Michael Phelps breaking world records left and right, it may seem like an easy thing to do. However, what they don’t show is the sweat, tears, and pain behind that world record time. Although I’m nowhere near Michael Phelp’s speed and dedication to the sport, I enjoy it enough to keep on trying even after I’ve failed miserably many, many, many times.</p>
					<p>Last year in the month of March was short course states (aka in a 25 yard pool for anyone not in America). That time of the year is always really nerve wrecking because you’ve prepared a whole season for 3 short days to determine your fate (cue the scary music). Talk about pressure, huh. Anyways, before that Sunday, I had never even thought about a junior national cut. I mean, it wasn’t even within my line of vision because I had never thought that I could achieve something that big (that’s another topic for another day). But on a fateful Sunday, after prelims in the 200 Backstroke, I discovered I was only 2 seconds away from the cut! I watched a video of me swimming in the morning-while eating some spaghetti, if I may add-and by the time finals came around, I was certain that I had a chance of making juniors. So finals came around, and I got behind the blocks.</p>
					<p>“Take your mark…*BEEEP*” said the official, and we were off.</p>
					<p>2:06.53 minutes later, I finished the race. The cut was a 2:05.99.</p>
					<p>Later that year in July, long course sectionals had come around and I was ready to make my dream come true. I had worked so hard the whole summer. I skipped parties, actually took time to listen to what my coach was saying, and really thought about how I could improve my stroke. The time of Judgement came in the form of a clock on July 24th, 2014.</p>
					<p>“Take your mark…*BEEEP**” said the official, and off we dove.</p>
					<p>1:07.89 minutes later, I touched the wall. The cut was a 1:07.19.</p>
					<p>That type of devastation was soul-wrenching. I had never been so put down in my life before. I couldn’t fathom why I couldn’t get the cut, even when I devoted such time and effort into making it happen. Was it something I ate? Was it fatigue from my previous races? Was it my nervous anxiety? But, as soon as those thoughts arrived, in came new thoughts. How can I healthy my eating habits? How can I recover from previous races? How can I turn nervousness into anticipation? I told myself, ‘you haven’t seen the light yet, Katie, so you must not be done’.</p>
					<p>Fast forward to March 2015. A year older, a year stronger, and a year wiser (though not so much in my chocolate cravings). The 200 Backstroke was staring back up at me from the heat sheet. I was about ready to vomit from all the butterflies I was feeling. That previous year’s “mishappenings” kept repeating in my head, but I just repeated my mantra “you are not done, you are not done”. In prelims I had gone faster than I had in the past year in prelims, so I told myself to stop being such a wuss and own the race, because all those salty tears in a chlorinated pool from last year hadn’t been for nothing. I stepped into the water when the official told us to, and as usual, he started off with a…</p>
					<p>“Take your mark…*BEEEP*” and off we went.</p>
					<p>2:05.86 minutes later, I crashed into the wall. The cut was a 2:05.99.</p>
					<p>If you haven’t seen the light, you are not finished.</p>
